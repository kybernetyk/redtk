redtk - the reddit account toolkit
	automates reddit account creation

so I had some credits left on decaptcher.com (don't ask) and all the nodejs bullshit
posts on reddit made me rage. as the internet is serious business I was naturally very 
mad and decided to create a reddit account army to downvote those hat wearing hippsters.

this here is the result of my evil deeds.

at first I tried to fake shit with http. but reddit is a 1st class javascript cesspool
and nothing worked out. (they check if you actually click on input fields before
they accept your input)

so I took good proven Apple technology and started automating safari over the
cocoa script bridge. it's so fucking easy - I just have to inject some javascript
code that manipulates the DOM and I'm ready to go. I have to say this is by far
the easiest automation/scraping I've ever done. I think this will become my
method of choice ...

the most complicated part of the project was to figure out the decaptcher http api ...

script kiddie starting guide:
  clone this repo and type "./build.sh"
  check out solve.sh to enter your decaptcher.com credentials
  ./newacc.sh $user $pass will create a new account for you

if you want to use these accounts to heavily spam reddit consider using proxies.
reddit is pretty paranoid about spam and if you act stupid your accounts will be gone.
also adding email support might help out to make your bot army more believable.

oh yeah, you will need OS X 10.6+, Safari 5 and XCode for this to work. 
no, there is no windows version and there won't be one. get a real computer and stop using
windows. also no linux version - I have no idea how to automate lynx.
